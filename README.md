# Vvpx

Unofficial AI vibe coded CMake build for libvpx, the WebM VP8/VP9 SDK.
The official repo isn't on Github, so we use ShiftMediaProject libvpx clone which seems to be actively maintained.

The idea is to clone that as a subrepo for easy integration, and then AI slop code a CMake build system on top.
